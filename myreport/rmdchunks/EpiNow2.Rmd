```

### Explanations

The package *EpiNow2* is used to estimate the effective, time-varying reproduction number, $Rt$, using a Bayesian inference method that requires data on observed infections, and an estimate of the generation time, which is approximated using the disease's serial interval distribution. $Rt$ estimates can be biased by reporting delays. For this reason, this report excludes the last `r params$incomplete_days` days included in the incidence data as incomplete,
and retains a total of `r params$r_estim_window` days to obtain the most recent estimate of the time varying reproduction number.

$Rt$ is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected individual would infect if
conditions remained as they were at time _t_. It represents the transmission potential of a disease at a specified timepoint. Observing changes in $Rt$ provides valuable information about variations in transmissibility during an epidemic, and can be used to assess the effectiveness of control interventions aimed at reducing virus transmission. 
For more information on *Rt* and its interpretation, see [this paper by the Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/set-c/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf).

### Results

```{r rt-wrappers-prep}
# This code takes the serial interval distribution of params$disease_name and
# uses it to approximate the disease's generation time
generation_time <-  generation_time_opts(
  dist_spec(pmf = density(si, at = si_x))
)
```

#### Global transmissibility

These analyses present results for the global incidence, i.e. without
stratification. Results include:
 
* a graph of the estimates of $R_t$ of the observed data over time, with
associated 95% credibility intervals
  
* a table summarising $Rt$ values for the last `r params$r_estim_window` days of available data

```{r rt-estim-global}
# This code uses {EpiNow2}'s function `epinow()` to estimate Rt over time
# from daily incidence data
# Warning, this step will take 2 cores of your computer and may be running
# for a long time!
res_epinow2_global <- dat_i_day %>%
  regroup() %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    confirm = count,
    date    = as.Date(date_index),
    .keep   = "unused"
  ) %>%
  epinow(
    generation_time = generation_time,
    stan = stan_opts(samples = 1e3, chains = 2),
    rt = rt_opts(gp_on = "R0"),
    horizon = 0,
    CrIs = c(0.5, 0.95),
    return_output = TRUE,
    verbose = FALSE,
    logs = NULL
  )
```

```{r rt-plot-global}
# Plot of Rt values over time for global incidence data (without stratification)
plot(res_epinow2_global, "R") +
  scale_x_date(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8), date_label = "%d %b %Y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "Instantaneous reproduction number (Rt)",
    title = "Estimates of Rt (EpiNow2)"
  )
```

```{r rt-table-global}
# This code generates a table that contains Rt estimates for the last
# params$r_estim_window
res_epinow2_global$estimates$summarised %>%
  dplyr::filter(variable == "R") %>%
  tail(params$r_estim_window) %>%
  dplyr::select(date, mean, median, lower_95, upper_95) %>%
  mutate(
    "mean $R$" = round(mean, 2),
    "median $R$" = round(median, 2),
    "95% ci" = sprintf(
      "[%1.2f ; %1.2f]",
      lower_95,
      upper_95
    ),
    .keep = "unused"
  ) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_paper("striped", font_size = 18, full_width = FALSE)
```

#### Transmissibility by group

These analyses present results for stratified incidence, i.e., by `r group_var`. Results include:
 
* a graph of the estimates of $R_t$ of the observed data over time, with associated 95% credibility intervals, stratified by `r group_var`

* a table with $Rt$ estimates for each `r group_var`, excluding the most recent `r params$incomplete_days` days from the available data 

```{r rt-estim-group, message = FALSE}
# This code uses {EpiNow2}'s function `epinow()` to estimate Rt over time
# from daily incidence data, stratified by group_var
# Warning, this step will take 2 cores of your computer and may be running
# for a long time!
res_epinow2_group <- dat_i_day %>%
  select("date_index", "region", "count") %>%
  dplyr::rename(
    confirm = count,
    date    = date_index,
    region  = .data[[group_var]]
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%
  regional_epinow(
    generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
    stan = stan_opts(samples = 1e3, chains = 2),
    rt = rt_opts(gp_on = "R0"),
    horizon = 0,
    CrIs = c(0.5, 0.95),
    return_output = TRUE,
    verbose = FALSE,
    logs = NULL
  )
```

```{r rt-plot-group}
# Plot of Rt estimates over time, stratified by group_var
res_epinow2_group$summary$plots$R
```

```{r rt-table-group}
# This code generates a table with an overall estimate of Rt per group_var
res_epinow2_group$summary$summarised_results$data %>%
  dplyr::filter(metric == "Effective reproduction no.") %>%
  dplyr::select(region, mean, median, lower_95, upper_95) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    "95% ci" = sprintf(
      "[%1.2f ; %1.2f]",
      lower_95,
      upper_95
    ),
    .keep = "unused"
  ) %>%
