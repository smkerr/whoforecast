### Explanations

The package *R0* is used to estimate the effective, time-varying reproduction number, $Rt$, implementing a time-dependent method, described by [Wallinga and Teunis](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/6/509/79472?login=false). This method requires incidence data and an estimate of the generation time, which here is approximated using the disease's serial interval distribution.
$Rt$ estimates can be biased by reporting delays. For this reason, this report excludes the last `r params$incomplete_days` days included in the incidence data as incomplete.

$Rt$ is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected individual would infect if
conditions remained as they were at time _t_. It represents the transmission potential of a disease at a specified timepoint. Observing changes in $Rt$ provides valuable information about variations in transmissibility during an epidemic, and can be used to assess the effectiveness of control interventions aimed at reducing virus transmission. 
For more information on *Rt* and its interpretation, see [this paper by the Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/set-c/set-covid-19-R-estimates.pdf).

### Results

```{r rt-wrappers-prep}
# This code uses the serial interval to approximate the generation time
mGT <- generation.time("empirical", si$prob_dist$d(si_x))

# Helper function to get R0 outputs in a tidy format, compatible with pipelines
r0_quantiles <- function(Rt) {
  res <- data.frame(
    median = Rt$R,
    lower  = Rt$conf.int$lower,
    upper  = Rt$conf.int$upper
  )
  # R0 set missing values as Rt = 0, which is probably not what we want
  res[res == 0] <- NA

  return(res)
}
```


#### Global transmissibility

These analyses present results for the global incidence, i.e. without
stratification. Results include:
 
* a graph of the estimates of $R_t$ of the observed data over time, with
associated 95% credibility intervals
  
* a table summarising these results for the last `r params$r_estim_window` days

```{r rt-estim-global}
# This code uses the {R0} function `estimate.R()` to generate Rt estimates over
# time using daily incidence data (dat_i_day)
res_r0_global <- dat_i_day %>%
  regroup() %>%
  mutate(r0_quantiles(estimate.R(
    get_count_value(.),
    mGT,
    date_index,
    begin = 1L, end = length(date_index),
    nsim = 1e4, method = "TD"
  )$estimates$TD)
  )
```

```{r rt-plot-global}
# Plot of global Rt estimates over time for daily incidence data included in
# dat_i_day
res_r0_global %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_index, y = median, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  geom_ribbon(fill = pale_green) +
  geom_line(color = dark_green) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, color = dark_pink) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "Instantaneous reproduction number (Rt)",
    title = "Estimates of Rt (R0)"
  )
```

```{r rt-table-global}
# This code generates a table with Rt estimates for the last
# `r params$r_estim_window` days included in dat_i_day
res_r0_global %>%
  tail(params$r_estim_window) %>%
  mutate(
    date = date_index,
    median = round(median, 2),
    `95% ci` = sprintf(
      "[%1.2f ; %1.2f]",
      lower,
      upper
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(date, median, `95% ci`) %>%
  rename(
    "median $R$" = median
  ) %>%
  set_names(toupper) %>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_paper("striped", font_size = 18, full_width = FALSE)
```

#### Transmissibility by group

These analyses present results for incidence stratified by `r group_var`. Results in this section include:
 
* a graph of the estimates of $R_t$ of the observed data over time for each `r group_var`, with
associated 95% credibility intervals
  
* a plot with the latest $R_t$ results by `r group_var`

* a table with the latest $R_t$ estimates by `r group_var`

```{r rt-estim-group}
# This code uses the {R0} function `estimate_R()` to obtain Rt estimates by
# group_var over time
res_r0_group <- dat_i_day %>%
  regroup(groups = get_group_names(.)) %>%
  arrange(date_index) %>%
  group_by(.data[[get_group_names(.)]]) %>%
  mutate(
    r0_quantiles(estimate.R(
      .data$count,
      mGT,
      date_index,
      begin = 1L, end = length(date_index),
      nsim = 1e4, method = "TD"
    )$estimates$TD)
  )
