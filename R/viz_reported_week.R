#'Visualise the reported and estimated reported cases by date of report
#'
#'@details A function to visualise estimated reported weekly cases as epinow
#'only shows as a continuous timeseries with no weekly periodicity.
#'This function aggregates reported case estimates to the weekly level and
#'overlays this on the weekly reported case epicurve.This is also needed as
#'epinow show breaks in estimates which we don't want across short time frames
#'
#'@param now_estimates List of estimates from the nowcasting/forecasting
#'@param adm_level sets the adm level for which data to pull with options adm0, adm1
