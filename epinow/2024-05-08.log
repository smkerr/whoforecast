WARN [2024-08-28 16:07:36] epinow: The generation time distribution should be given to `generation_time_opts` using a `dist_spec`. This behaviour has changed from previous versions of `EpiNow2` and any code using it may need to be updated as any other ways of specifying the generation time are deprecated and will be removed in the next version. For examples and more information, see the relevant documentation pages using `?generation_time_opts` - generation_time_opts, get_gen_time()
